<!-- Tuition fee section-->
				</div>
				<div class="second" id="second">
					<h1 class="body-ttl">Financials</h1>
					<p class="txt4">Currently, the full tuition fee for one academic year is $39,924. The Corporation of Yale University reserves the right to revise tuition rates as necessary.</p>
					<h1 class="body-ttl1">Financial Aid</h1>
					<p class="txt4">The Financial Aid process for the Yale School of Art’s graduate MFA program functions cyclically with each academic year. Students are responsible for submitting different Financial Aid-related information depending on where they are in the Financial Aid process.</p>
					<h1 class="body-ttl1">Types of Financial Aids</h1>
					<h1 class="body-ttl2">Scholarships</h1>
					<p class="txt4">When the total amount of the student contribution, parent contribution, employment/work-study and loans do not meet a student’s full financial need, scholarship funds are awarded. Scholarships are also known as grant or gift aid and, unlike loans, do not have to be repaid. If your financial aid applications are received and processed by the School’s deadline and you have calculated need, the School makes every effort to award a substantial scholarship to you. Scholarship availability is based on the number of students with calculated financial need within the School and the amount of funds available.</p>
					<p class="txt4">Scholarship is need-based and only awarded to accepted students who’ve applied for aid and have demonstrated need. The maximum scholarship for first-year students does not exceed tuition costs.</p>
					<h1 class="body-ttl2">Loans</h1>
					<p class="txt4">A portion of your financial need will be met with an offer of a unit loan. Your loan offer is composed of loans from either the Federal Direct Loan Programs if you are a U.S. Citizen/Permanent Resident or an alternative/private bank/Yale International Student loan if you do not qualify for the federal loan programs or you are an International Student.</p>
					<p class="txt4">Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program - The Direct Unsubsidized Loan is a federal loan with an annual limit of $20,500. Interest charges accrue during enrollment. Students may borrow an amount up to the cost of attendance minus any financial aid. The fixed interest rate for the current/upcoming academic year for all borrowers is 6.6% with a 1.062% fee.</p>
					<p class="txt4">Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan - Credit–worthy Graduate students may borrow a loan in an amount up to the cost of attendance less any other financial aid offered. The terms and conditions include: a requirement that the applicant not have an adverse credit history; a repayment period that begins on the date of the last disbursement of the loan; and a fixed interest rate of 7.6% with a 4.248% fee.</p>
					<p class="txt4">Federal Direct Loan Application Process - Yale University participates exclusively in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program. Borrowers will obtain loan funds directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This program offers students a more streamlined, stable and predictable borrowing experience.</p>
					<h1 class="body-ttl1">Work-study & Part-time employment</h1>
					<p class="txt4">Work-study as part of your financial aid award indicates eligibility for a job within Yale. There are a number of jobs within the School of Art (admissions, labs, studio crews, etc.) that paid $14.25 per hour in 2019-20. If you are awarded a job within the School, you will be notified by the supervisor. Generally, it will involve four-to-six hours a week during the regular academic year only.</p>
					<p class="txt4">Work-study positions available within the School of Art may be limited and not all MFA students necessarily will be assigned a job within the School. So it is suggested you examine the Yale Student Employment Office (246 Church Street) online student job search. This job search engine lists campus, community service (Federal Work Study) and other categories of employment for which you can apply online</p>

<!-- Housing section-->
				<div class="third" id="third">
					<h1 class="body-ttl">Housing Guidance</h1>
					<h1 class="body-ttl1">Off Campus Fousing Resources</h1>
					<p class="txt4">Yale is home to 6,500 Graduate and Professional School students, many of whom prefer to live off campus. The University offers limited on-campus housing options for graduate and PhD students, so the Yale Housing Office maintains a portal with Off-Campus Listings in which the property owners are verified.</p>
					<p class="txt4">We recommend starting there, or with listings that will be updated on this page from within the School of Art community, or on the closed Facebook Group. As you look for apartments Yale recommends trying to stay within the Yale Shuttle routes to benefit from this service as well as campus safety resources such as the LiveSafe app, but this is of course up to you.</p>
					<p class="txt4">Additionally, students leaving the program will soon have apartments that they are vacating, and we will begin posting those opportunities here; there are some property owners in the vicinity who have routinely rented to School of Art and Architecture students and those individuals can be easy to work with.</p>
					<p class="txt4">When using outside listing resources such as Facebook or Craigslist, be mindful of course of scams and bad actors. Anyone presenting themselves as a Yale student, staff or faculty should be able to verify their identity with a university email address that ends either in yale.edu orbulldogs.yale.edu; NEVER @yale.com. Do not send passwords, verification codes or money to anyone without verifying their identity or signing a vetted lease.*</p>
					<h1 class="body-ttl">Recommended Areas</h1>
					<p class="txt4">Most MFA students opt to live off-campus, and where they choose to do so is a personal preference. The information compiled here is from the advice of previously enrolled students; the School itself does not endorse any specific properties or management companies.</p>
					<p class="txt4">The Yale Office of Off-Campus Housing advises students to consider housing within the perimeter of the Yale Shuttle routes however the University is large so proximity to School of Art buildings should be considered.</p>
					<p class="txt4">The School of Art has three main buildings which house departmental facilities and workspace, the addresses of which are:<br>-Green Hall, 1156 Chapel St (Graphic Design Studios, Photo Labs/Studios)<br>-353 Crown Street (Painting Studios)<br>-36 Edgewood Ave (Sculpture Studios, some Photography Studios)</p>
					<p class="txt4">Student feedback indicates that East Rock, Wooster Square, Westville or the Whitney Ave. sections of town are popular areas for those who don’t mind a longer walk though the majority of students live in close proximity to the School for convenience when keeping late hours in the studio. Streets closest to the School include Chapel, York, Park, Howe, High, Dwight, Edgewood, Crown, College, Elm, Broadway, and Lynwood. That said, please consult the linked map to check the specific numbered address in relation to campus.</p>
					<h1 class="body-ttl">Graduate Student Life Resources</h1>
					<p class="txt4">Yale School of Art is committed to fostering a safe, just and equitable environment for learning, experimentation and discovery, and to encouraging healthy self-care habits.</p>
					<p class="txt4">Enrolled students with general questions, concerns or ideas to share with regards to student relations and academic affairs should start by contacting Taryn Wolf, Director of Academic Administration and Dean’s Designee, and/or the Director of Graduate Study (DGS) or Graduate Coordinator in their area.</p>
					<p class="txt4">Students are encouraged to explore the expansive resources offered by the University during their time at the School. Additionally, you may recommend a particular resource be added to this quick link list by emailing taryn.wolf@yale.edu</p>
